"""
Description: 
    Function that loops while the client is online and listens for any messages sent to the client socket.

Based on the type of message recieved this function can:
    Print the contents of the message
    Quit the function and trigger the thread to quit if the exit command is received
    Check to see if the integrity of the message has been preserved

How it works:
    Creates a socket that it continuously listens to 
    Decodes the message receieved from the server
    Retrieves the header associated with the message and creates its own header from the message it recieved
        If the two match up then the message is valid and it is printed
        Else: the server is notified the message has been corrupted and is 
        initated to go into loss recovery, the client does notprint the message

Parameters:
    None

Return:
    None
